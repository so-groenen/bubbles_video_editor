# Bubbles video editor

#### TODO:

* change names -> bubbles (rust files + toml)
* adding new videos while a video is being processed should not be possible
* add channels to send/update "re-scale" and "rotation" to rotate & rescale in "preview-mode"
* add a pause/play button or/and selector, but we need to be able to "rescale/rotate" also in paused mode
* ideally one should be able to "cut" the video to the desired length using a "position selector"
